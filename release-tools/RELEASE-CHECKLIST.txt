1.  Clone and move to the specific branch. For example:

       git clone https://github.com/pegasus-isi/pegasus.git
       cd pegasus
       git checkout N.M

2.  Set the version number in build.properties and commit:

       git commit -a -m "Setting version for tag"

3.  Tag. Example:

        git tag -a -m "Created tag for N.M.O" N.M.O

4.  Open branch for new checkins with new version:

       vim build.properties
       git commit -a -m "Branch reopen for checkins"

5.  Bring the branch back to master, but ignore the commits.

       git checkout master
       git merge --no-commit N.M
    (edit build.properties)
       git commit -a -m "Merged N.M"

6.  git push --tags
