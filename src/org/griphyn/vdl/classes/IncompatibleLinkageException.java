/**
 * This exception is thrown if the matching between the linkage of a declared variable and the
 * combined linkage of a used variable in a transformation have incompatible values. An example for
 * such an incompatability is having declared a variable of type input, but using it as ouput. The
 * exception will also be thrown, if multiple usages of a bound variable use incompatible linkages,
 * e.g. the same variable is used with linkage NONE in one instance, and with any other linkage in
 * the same transformation at another place.
 *
 * <p>A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException
 * that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught.
