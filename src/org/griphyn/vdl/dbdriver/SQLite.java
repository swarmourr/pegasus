/**
 * This class implements the driver API for the free, small, and fast file-based SQL Lite. This
 * class is currently an empty non-working stand-in. Refer to the <a
 * href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> site for details. We will fill this stand-in with life
 * at some later time.
 *
 * <p>In order to use the SQLite driver, you must install the SQLite software first. Additionally,
 * it is necessary to install the Java SQLite wrapper, which comes in two part. The JAR file is
 * included with the VDS distribution. However, it is also necessary to either install the shared
 * JNI library into your Java runtime, or point your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the shared library.
