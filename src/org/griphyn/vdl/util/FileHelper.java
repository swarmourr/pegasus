/**
 * This class allows access to a set of files. With the constructor, the basename of the fileset is
 * specified. From this file, a set of 10 files can be accessed and constructed, with suffices ".0"
 * to ".9". A cursor file, suffix ".nr", points to the currently active file in the ring.
 *
 * <p>In read mode, the cursor file gets locked temporarily while the stream is opened. If no cursor
 * file exists, it is assumed that the basename is also the filename of the database. A lock file
 * for the opened database will be created.
 *
 * <p>In write mode, the cursor file gets locked until the writer is being closed again. Thus,
 * parallel access by other writers or readers are prohibited. The cursor is advanced at stream
 * close. The database stream points to the next file beyong the cursor. If no cursor file existed,
 * it will point to suffix ".0".
 *
 * <p>All access to the files must go through the respective open and close methods provided by this
 * class in order to guarantee proper locking!
