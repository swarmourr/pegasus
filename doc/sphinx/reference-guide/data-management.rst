Data Management
===============

One of the key features of Pegasus is it's end to end data management
of datasets tracked in your workflow. Pegasus is responsible for selecting
the best replica for your inputs, transferring them to a location where
jobs in your workflow can access them, cleaning up datasets no longer
required as the workflow runs, to staging out and registering the
generated outputs to locations of your choosing. Majority of the
data management optimizations occur during the
:ref:`mapping phase <mapping-refinement-steps>` , where the input Abstract
Workflow in converted to an Executable Workflow that can be executed
on your target infrastructure.

This chapter provides details of all data management capabilities
in Pegasus.


.. _replica-selection:

Replica Selection
=================

Each job in the Abstract Workflow maybe associated with input LFN's denoting
the files that are required for the job to run. To determine the physical
replica (PFN) for a LFN, Pegasus queries the Replica catalog to get all the
PFN's (replicas) associated with a LFN. The Replica Catalog may return
multiple PFN's for each of the LFN's queried. Hence, Pegasus needs to
select a single PFN amongst the various PFN's returned for each LFN.
This process is known as replica selection in Pegasus. Users can specify
the replica selector to use in the properties file.

This document describes the various Replica Selection Strategies in
Pegasus.

Configuration
-------------

The user properties determine what replica selector Pegasus Workflow
Mapper uses. The property **pegasus.selector.replica** is used to
specify the replica selection strategy. Currently supported Replica
Selection strategies are

1. Default

2. Regex

3. Restricted

4. Local

The values are case sensitive. For example the following property
setting will throw a Factory Exception .

::

   pegasus.selector.replica  default

The correct way to specify is

::

   pegasus.selector.replica  Default

Supported Replica Selectors
---------------------------

The various Replica Selectors supported in Pegasus Workflow Mapper are
explained below.

.. note::

   Starting 4.6.0 release the Default and Regex Replica Selectors return
   an ordered list with priorities set. *pegasus-transfer* at runtime will
   failover to alternate url's specified, if a higher priority source
   URL is inaccessible.

.. _replica-selection-default:

Default
~~~~~~~

This is the default replica selector used in the Pegasus Workflow
Mapper. If the property pegasus.selector.replica is not defined in
properties, then Pegasus uses this selector.

The selector orders the various candidate replica's according to the
following rules

1. valid file URL's . That is URL's that have the site attribute
   matching the site where the executable *pegasus-transfer* is
   executed.

2. all URL's from preferred site (usually the compute site)

3. all other remotely accessible ( non file) URL's

To use this replica selector set the following property

::

   pegasus.selector.replica                  Default

Regex
~~~~~

This replica selector allows the user to specific regular expressions
that can be used to rank various PFN's returned from the Replica Catalog
for a particular LFN. This replica selector orders the replicas based on
the rank. Lower the rank higher the preference.

The regular expressions are assigned different rank, that determine the
order in which the expressions are employed. The rank values for the
regex can expressed in user properties using the property.

::

   pegasus.selector.replica.regex.rank.[value]                  regex-expression

The **[value]** in the above property is an integer value that denotes
the rank of an expression with a rank value of 1 being the highest rank.

For example, a user can specify the following regex expressions that
will ask Pegasus to prefer file URL's over gsiftp url's from
example.isi.edu

::

   pegasus.selector.replica.regex.rank.1                       file://.*
   pegasus.selector.replica.regex.rank.2                       gsiftp://example\.isi\.edu.*

User can specify as many regex expressions as they want.

Since Pegasus is in Java , the regex expression support is what Java
supports. It is pretty close to what is supported by Perl. More details
can be found at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

Before applying any regular expressions on the PFN's for a particular
LFN that has to be staged to a site X, the file URL's that don't match
the site X are explicitly filtered out.

To use this replica selector set the following property

::

   pegasus.selector.replica                  Regex

Restricted
~~~~~~~~~~

This replica selector, allows the user to specify good sites and bad
sites for staging in data to a particular compute site. A good site for
a compute site X, is a preferred site from which replicas should be
staged to site X. If there are more than one good sites having a
particular replica, then a random site is selected amongst these
preferred sites.

A bad site for a compute site X, is a site from which replicas should
not be staged. The reason of not accessing replica from a bad site can
vary from the link being down, to the user not having permissions on
that site's data.

The good \| bad sites are specified by the following properties

::

   pegasus.replica.*.prefer.stagein.sites
   pegasus.replica.*.ignore.stagein.sites

where the \* in the property name denotes the name of the compute site.
A \* in the property key is taken to mean all sites. The value to these
properties is a comma separated list of sites.

For example the following settings

::

   pegasus.selector.replica.*.prefer.stagein.sites            usc
   pegasus.replica.uwm.prefer.stagein.sites                   isi,cit

means that prefer all replicas from site usc for staging in to any
compute site. However, for uwm use a tighter constraint and prefer only
replicas from site isi or cit. The pool attribute associated with the
PFN's tells the replica selector to what site a replica/PFN is
associated with.

The pegasus.replica.*.prefer.stagein.sites property takes precedence
over pegasus.replica.*.ignore.stagein.sites property i.e. if for a site
X, a site Y is specified both in the ignored and the preferred set, then
site Y is taken to mean as only a preferred site for a site X.

To use this replica selector set the following property

::

   pegasus.selector.replica                  Restricted

.. _replica-selection-local:

Local
~~~~~

This replica selector always prefers replicas from the local host ( pool
attribute set to local ) and that start with a file: URL scheme. It is
useful, when users want to stagein files to a remote site from the
submit host using the Condor file transfer mechanism.

To use this replica selector set the following property

::

   pegasus.selector.replica                  Local

.. _transfer-protocols:

Supported Transfer Protocols
============================

Pegasus refers to a python script called **pegasus-transfer** as the
executable in the transfer jobs to transfer the data. pegasus-transfer
looks at source and destination url and figures out automatically which
underlying client to use. pegasus-transfer is distributed with the
PEGASUS and can be found at $PEGASUS_HOME/bin/pegasus-transfer.

Currently, pegasus-transfer interfaces with the following transfer
clients

.. table:: Transfer Clients interfaced to by pegasus-transfer

   =============== ====================================================================================
   Transfer Client Used For
   =============== ====================================================================================
   gfal-copy       staging file to and from GridFTP servers
   globus-url-copy staging files to and from GridFTP servers, only if gfal is not detected in the path.
   globus          staging files between globus endpoints using the globus transfer service
   gfal-copy       staging files to and from SRM or XRootD servers
   wget            staging files from a HTTP server
   cp              copying files from a POSIX filesystem
   ln              symlinking against input files
   pegasus-s3      staging files to and from S3 buckets in Amazon Web Services, Open Storage Network (OSN)
   gsutil          staging files to and from Google Storage buckets
   scp             staging files using scp
   gsiscp          staging files using gsiscp and X509
   iget            staging files to and from iRODS servers
   htar            to retrieve input files from HPSS tape storage
   docker          to pull images from Docker hub
   singularity     to pull images from Singularity hub and Singularity library (Sylabs Cloud)
   curl            staging files from a Webdav server
   =============== ====================================================================================

For remote sites, Pegasus constructs the default path to
pegasus-transfer on the basis of PEGASUS_HOME env profile specified in
the site catalog. To specify a different path to the pegasus-transfer
client , users can add an entry into the transformation catalog with
fully qualified logical name as **pegasus::pegasus-transfer**

.. _transfer-s3:

Amazon S3 (s3://)
-----------------

Pegasus can be configured to use Amazon S3 as a staging site. In this
mode, Pegasus transfers workflow inputs from the input site to S3. When
a job runs, the inputs for that job are fetched from S3 to the worker
node, the job is executed, then the output files are transferred from
the worker node back to S3. When the jobs are complete, Pegasus
transfers the output data from S3 to the output site.

In order to use S3, it is necessary to create a config file for the S3
transfer client, :ref:`pegasus-s3 <cli-pegasus-s3>`.
You also need to specify :ref:`S3 as a staging site <non-shared-fs>`.

Next, you need create a Pegasus credentials files. See 
`the section on credential staging <#cred-staging>`__. This file is
picked up automatically when your workflow contains s3 transfers.


.. _transfer-osn:

Open Storage Network OSN (osn://)
---------------------------------

Pegasus can be configured to use buckets in Open Storage Network (OSGN)
as a staging site. OSN provides a S3 compatible interface to retrieve
and put files in a bucket.

In order to use S3, it is necessary to create a config file for the S3
transfer client, :ref:`pegasus-s3 <cli-pegasus-s3>`.
You also need to specify :ref:`S3 as a staging site <non-shared-fs>`.

Next, you need create a Pegasus credentials files. See
`the section on credential staging <#cred-staging>`__. This file is
picked up automatically when your workflow contains OSN transfers.
Please add a section in it describing your endpoint. For example
to use OSN deployment at XSEDE.

::

  [osn]
  endpoint = https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org

  [joe@osn]
  access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  secret_key = abababababababababababababababab

To associate OSN as a staging area for your condorpool site, you can
associate shared scratch directory to be a bucket in OSN

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python generate_sc.py

        from Pegasus.api import *

        sc = SiteCatalog()
        condorpool = Site("condorpool", arch=Arch.X86_64, os_type=OS.LINUX)

        # create and add a bucket in OSN to use for your workflows
        condorpool_shared_scratch_dir = Directory(Directory.SHARED_SCRATCH, path="/asc190064-bucket01/pegasus-workflows") \
            .add_file_servers(
            FileServer("s3://joe@osn/asc190064-bucket01/pegasus-workflows/", Operation.ALL),
        )
        condorpool.add_directories(condorpool_shared_scratch_dir)
        condorpool.add_pegasus_profiles(style="condor")
        sc.add_sites(condorpool)

    .. code-tab:: yaml YAML SC

        pegasus: '5.0'
        siteCatalog:
          sites:
          - name: condorpool
            arch: x86_64
            os.type: linux
            directories:
            - type: sharedScratch
              path: /asc190064-bucket01/pegasus-workflows/
              sharedFileSystem: false
              fileServers:
              - url: s3://joe@osn/asc190064-bucket01/pegasus-workflows
                operation: all
            profiles:
              pegasus:
                style: condor


.. note::

   The OSN endpoint is defined in the credentials.conf and in the
   URL's in the site catalog, you refer it with the alias. In this
   example that is *osn*

.. _transfer-docker:

Docker (docker://)
------------------

Container images can be pulled directly from Docker Hub using Docker
URLs. Example: docker://pegasus/osg-el7

Example: docker://pegasus/osg-el7

Only public images are supported at this time.


.. _transfer-file:

File / Symlink (file:// , symlink://)
-------------------------------------

.. _transfer-globus-online:

Globus Online (go://)
---------------------

`Globus Online <http://globus.org>`__ is a transfer service with
features such as policy based connection management and automatic
failure detection and recovery. Pegasus has limited the support for
Globus Online transfers.

If you want to use Globus Online in your workflow, all data has to be
accessible via a Globus Online endpoint. You can not mix Globus Online
endpoints with other protocols. For most users, this means they will
have to create an endpoint for their submit host and probably modify
both the replica catalog and Abstract Workflow generator so that all URLs in the
workflow are for Globus Online endpoints.

There are two levels of credentials required. One is for the workflow to
use the Globus Online API, which is handled by OAuth tokens, provided by
Globus Auth service. The second level is for the endpoints, which the
user will have to manage via the Globus Online web interface. The
required steps are:

1. Using *pegasus-globus-online-init*, provide authorization to Pegasus
   and retrieve your transfer access tokens. By default Pegasus acquires
   temporary tokens that expire within a few days. Using --permanent
   option you can request refreshable tokens that last indefinetely (or
   until access is revoked). With endpoints running Globus Connect Server(GCS)
   versions 5.4+ data collections may require *data_access* consent to allow
   to operate on them (e.g., transfers). Endpoints that support this usually
   have their *host_id* set to None. To acquire *data_access* consent for
   these endpoints under pegasus, you can use the --endpoints option and list
   the *UUIDs* of the endpoints you would like to give pegasus consent for.

2. In the Globus Online web interface, under Endpoints, find the
   endpoints you need for the workflow, and activate them. Note that you
   should activate them for the whole duration of the workflow or you
   will have to regularly log in and re-activate the endpoints during
   workflow execution.

URLs for Globus Online endpoint data follows the following scheme:
*go://[endpoint]/[path]*. For example, for a user with the Globus Online
private endpoint *bob#researchdata* and a file
*/home/bsmith/experiment/1.dat*, the URL would be:
*go://bob#researchdata/home/bsmith/experiment/1.dat*

Additionally you can use the UUIDs of the endpoints directly and not their
Legacy Names. For example:
*go://56569ec1-adn1-4785-a6c1-8524231c7a6d/home/bsmith/experiment/1.dat*


.. _transfer-gridftp:

GridFTP (gsiftp://)
-------------------

Preference of GFAL over GUC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JGlobus is no longer actively supported and is not in compliance with
`RFC
2818 <https://docs.globus.org/security-bulletins/2015-12-strict-mode>`__
. As a result cleanup jobs using pegasus-gridftp client would fail
against the servers supporting the strict mode. We have removed the
pegasus-gridftp client and now use gfal clients as globus-url-copy does
not support removes. If gfal is not available, globus-url-copy is used
for cleanup by writing out zero bytes files instead of removing them.

If you want to force globus-url-copy to be preferred over GFAL, set the
**PEGASUS_FORCE_GUC=1** environment variable in the site catalog for the
sites you want the preference to be enforced. Please note that we expect
globus-url-copy support to be completely removed in future releases of
Pegasus due to the end of life of Globus Toolkit (see
`announcement <https://www.globus.org/blog/support-open-source-globus-toolkit-ends-january-2018>`__).

.. _transfer-gridftp-ssh:

GridFTP over SSH (sshftp://)
----------------------------

Instead of using X.509 based security, newer version of Globus GridFTP
can be configured to set up transfers over SSH. See the `Globus
Documentation <http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/6.0/gridftp/admin/#gridftp-admin-config-security-sshftp>`__
for details on installing and setting up this feature.

Pegasus requires the ability to specify which SSH key to be used at
runtime, and thus a small modification is necessary to the default
Globus configuration. On the hosts where Pegasus initiates transfers
(which depends on the data configuration of the workflow), please
replace *gridftp-ssh*, usually located under
*/usr/share/globus/gridftp-ssh*, with:

::

   #!/bin/bash

   url_string=$1
   remote_host=$2
   port=$3
   user=$4

   port_str=""
   if  [ "X" = "X$port" ]; then
       port_str=""
   else
       port_str=" -p $port "
   fi

   if  [ "X" != "X$user" ]; then
       remote_host="$user@$remote_host"
   fi

   remote_default1=.globus/sshftp
   remote_default2=/etc/grid-security/sshftp
   remote_fail="echo -e 500 Server is not configured for SSHFTP connections.\\\r\\\n"
   remote_program=$GLOBUS_REMOTE_SSHFTP
   if  [ "X" = "X$remote_program" ]; then
       remote_program="(( test -f $remote_default1 && $remote_default1 ) || ( test -f $remote_default2 && $remote_default2 ) || $remote_fail )"
   fi

   if [ "X" != "X$GLOBUS_SSHFTP_PRINT_ON_CONNECT" ]; then
       echo "Connecting to $1 ..." >/dev/tty
   fi

   # for pegasus-transfer
   extra_opts=" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
   if [ "x$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" != "x" ]; then
       extra_opts="$extra_opts -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY"
   fi

   exec /usr/bin/ssh $extra_opts $port_str $remote_host $remote_program

Once configured, you should be able to use URLs such as
*sshftp://username@host/foo/bar.txt* in your workflows.

.. _transfer-google-storage:

Google Storage (gs://)
----------------------

.. _transfer-http:

HTTP (http:// , https://)
-------------------------

.. _transfer-hpss:

HPSS (hpss://)
--------------

We support retrieval of input files from a tar file in HPSS storage
using the htar command. The naming convention to describe the tar file
and the file to retrieve fro the tar file is as follows

::

   hpss:///some-name.tar/path/in-tar-to/file.txt

For example: for e.g hpss:///test.tar/set1/f.a

For efficient retrieval pegasus-transfer bin's all the hpss transfers in
the .in file

-  fiirst by the tar file and then

-  the destination directory.

Binning by destination directory is done to support deep LFN's. Also
thing to note is that htar command returns success even if a file does
not exist in the archive. pegasus-transfer tries to make sure after the
transfer that the destination file exists and is readable.

HPSS requires a token to generated for retrieval. Information on how to
specify the token location can be found `here <#hpss_cred>`__.

.. _transfer-irods:

iRODS (irods://)
----------------

iRODS can be used as a input data location, a storage site for
intermediate data during workflow execution, or a location for final
output data. Pegasus uses a URL notation to identify iRODS files.
Example:

::

   irods://some-host.org/path/to/file.txt


The path to the file is **relative** to the internal iRODS location. In
the example above, the path used to refer to the file in iRODS is
*path/to/file.txt* (no leading /).

See `the section on credential staging <#cred_staging>`__ for
information on how to set up an irodsEnv file to be used by Pegasus.

.. _transfer-stashcp:

OSG Stash / stashcp (osdf:// stash://)
--------------------------------------

Open Science Grid provides a data service called Stash, and the command
line tool *stashcp* for interacting with the Stash data. An example on
how to set up the site catalog and URLs can be found in the `OSG User
Support Pegasus
tutorial <https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/htc_workloads/automated_workflows/tutorial-pegasus/>`__


.. _transfer-scp:

SCP (scp://)
------------

.. _transfer-singularity:

Singularity (<shub \| library>://)
----------------------------------

Container images can be pulled directly from Singularity hub and
Singularity library depending on the version of Singularity installed on
a node requiring the container image. Singularity hub images require at
least Singularity v2.3, while Singularity library images require at
least Singularity v3.0.

Example: shub://vsoch/singularity-images

Example: library://sylabsed/examples/lolcow

Only public images are supported at this time.

.. _transfer-webdav:

WebDAV (webdav://, webdavs://)
------------------------------

Authenticated WebDAV transfers uses the
`credential staging <#cred-staging>`__ file. Please add a section in
it describing your endpoint. For example:

..

  [data.cyverse.org]
  username = myname
  password = abc123


.. _cred-staging:

Credentials Management
======================

Pegasus tries to do data staging from localhost by default, but some
data scenarios makes some `remote jobs do data
staging <#local_vs_remote_transfers>`__. An example of such a case is
when running in `nonsharedfs <#ref_data_staging_configuration>`__ mode.
Depending on the transfer protocols used, the job may have to carry
credentials to enable these data transfers. To specify where which
credential to use and where Pegasus can find it, use environment
variable profiles in your site catalog. The supported credential types
are X.509 grid proxies, Amazon AWS S3 keys, Google Cloud Platform OAuth
token (.boto file), iRods password and SSH keys.

Credentials are usually associated per site in the site catalog. Users
can associate the credentials either as a Pegasus profile or an
environment profile with the site.

1. A pegasus profile with the value pointing to the path to the
   credential on the local site or the submit host. If a pegasus
   credential profile associated with the site, then Pegasus
   automatically transfers it along with the remote jobs.

2. A env profile with the value pointing to the path to the credential
   on the remote site. If an env profile is specified, then no
   credential is transferred along with the job. Instead the job's
   environment is set to ensure that the job picks up the path to the
   credential on the remote site.

..

In case of data transfer jobs, it is possible to associate different
credentials for a single file transfer ( one for the source server and
the other for the destination server) . For example, when leveraging
GridFTP transfers between two sides that accept different grid
credentials such as XSEDE Stampede site and NCSA Bluewaters. In that
case, Pegasus picks up the associated credentials from the site catalog
entries for the source and the destination sites associated with the
transfer.

.. _credentialsconf-cred:

~/.pegasus/credentials.conf
---------------------------

Pegasus has a generic credentials file located under
``~/.pegasus/credentials.conf``. This file is currently used for
WebDAV and S3 transfers, but more protocols will probably be moved
to this model in the future. To get started, create
``~/.pegasus/credentials.conf`` and ensure the file is only 
readable by the current user:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ chmod 600 ~/.pegasus/credentials.conf

The format of the file is following the
`Python INI format <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`__
where the section headers refer to a storage system. For basic
protocols, the section name is the hostname, and for clouds, it
is just an arbitrary name with an endpoint entry. Example:

::

    # For simple username/password protocols, such as WebDAV,
    # just specify the hostname and credentials. In this
    # example, the credentials would be used for URLs
    # matching the section, such as  
    # webdav://data.cyverse.org/some/file.txt

    [data.cyverse.org]

    username = joe
    password = secretsauce1

    # For S3 access, you can create an entry for the cloud
    # specific options, and then one or more user specific
    # entries with a key @ matching the cloud one (for
    # example, [amazon] and [joe@amazon] below)

    [amazon]
    endpoint = https://s3.amazonaws.com/

    [joe@amazon]
    access_key = 90c4143642cb097c88fe2ec66ce4ad4e
    secret_key = abababababababababababababababab


The ``~/.pegasus/credentials.conf`` file will be picked up
automatically by the planner and sent with the job in case
the credentials are needed.


.. _x509-cred:

X.509 Grid Proxies
------------------

If the grid proxy is required by transfer jobs, and the proxy is in the
standard location, Pegasus will pick the proxy up automatically. For
non-standard proxy locations, you can use the ``X509_USER_PROXY``
environment variable. Site catalog example:

::

   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="X509_USER_PROXY" >/some/location/x509up</profile>

.. _gs-cred:

Google Storage
--------------

If a workflow is using gs:// URLs, Pegasus needs access to a Google
Storage service account. First generate the credential by following the
instructions at:

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts

Download the credential in PKCS12 format, and then use "gsutil config
-e" to generate a .boto file. For example:

::

   $ gsutil config -e
   This command will create a boto config file at /home/username/.boto
   containing your credentials, based on your responses to the following
   questions.
   What is your service account email address? some-identifier@developer.gserviceaccount.com
   What is the full path to your private key file? /home/username/my-cred.p12
   What is the password for your service key file [if you haven't set one
   explicitly, leave this line blank]?

   Please navigate your browser to https://cloud.google.com/console#/project,
   then find the project you will use, and copy the Project ID string from the
   second column. Older projects do not have Project ID strings. For such projects,
   click the project and then copy the Project Number listed under that project.

   What is your project-id? your-project-id

   Boto config file "/home/username/.boto" created. If you need to use a
   proxy to access the Internet please see the instructions in that file.


Pegasus has to be told where to find both the .boto file as well as the
PKCS12 file. For the files to be picked up by the workflow, set the
``BOTO_CONFIG`` and ``GOOGLE_PKCS12`` profiles for the storage site.
Site catalog example:

::

   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="BOTO_CONFIG" >/home/user/.boto</profile>
   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="GOOGLE_PKCS12" >/home/user/.google-service-account.p12</profile>

.. _irods-cred:

iRods Password and Tickets
--------------------------

If a workflow is using iRods URLs, Pegasus has to be given an
irods_environment.json file. It is a standard file, with the addtion of
an password attribute, and optionally one for the ticket strong.
Example:

::

   {
       "irods_host": "some.host.edu",
       "irods_port": 1247,
       "irods_user_name": "someuser",
       "irods_zone_name": "somezone",
       "irodsPassword" : "somesecretpassword"
   }

The ``irodsPassword`` is a required attribute when using iRods in
Pegasus. There is also an optional attribute for passing iRods tickets,
called ``irodsTicket``. Please note that the the password one is still
needed, even when using tickets. Example:

::

   {
       "irods_host": "some.host.edu",
       "irods_port": 1247,
       "irods_user_name": "someuser",
       "irods_zone_name": "somezone",
       "irodsPassword" : "somesecretpassword"
       "irodsPassword" : "someticket"
   }

The location of the file can be given to the workflow using the
``IRODS_ENVIRONMENT_FILE`` environment profile. Site catalog example:

::

   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="IRODS_ENVIRONMENT_FILE" >${HOME}/.irods/irods_environment.json</profile>

.. _ssh-cred:

SSH Keys
--------

New in Pegasus 4.0 is the support for data staging with scp using ssh
public/private key authentication. In this mode, Pegasus transports a
private key with the jobs. The storage machines will have to have the
public part of the key listed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

   **Warning**

   SSH keys should be handled in a secure manner. In order to keep your
   personal ssh keys secure, It is recommended that a special set of
   keys are created for use with the workflow. Note that Pegasus will
   not pick up ssh keys automatically. The user will have to specify
   which key to use with ``SSH_PRIVATE_KEY``.

The location of the ssh private key can be specified with the
``SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`` environment profile. Site catalog example:

::

   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" >/home/user/wf/wfsshkey</profile>

.. _hpss-cred:

HPSS Tokens
-----------

You need to logon to the remote system and generate a token that is
required by htar for retrieving files from HPSS.

To pass the location of the credential you can associate an environment
variable called HPSS_CREDENTIAL with your job. Site Catalog Example:

::

   <profile namespace="pegasus" key="HPSS_CREDENTIAL" >/path/to/.netrc</profile>

If it is specified, pegasus-transfer copies credential to the default
credential location $HOME/.netrc.

If not specified, it makes sure the default credential $HOME/.netrc is
available

.. _ref-staging-mapper:

Staging Mappers
===============

Starting 4.7 release, Pegasus has support for staging mappers in the
**nonsharedfs** data configuration. The staging mappers determine what
sub directory on the staging site a job will be associated with. Before,
the introduction of staging mappers, all files associated with the jobs
scheduled for a particular site landed in the same directory on the
staging site. As a result, for large workflows this could degrade
filesystem performance on the staging servers.

To configure the staging mapper, you need to specify the following
property

::

   pegasus.dir.staging.mapper  <name of the mapper to use>

The following mappers are supported currently, with Hashed being the
default .

1. **Flat** : This mapper results in Pegasus placing all the job submit
   files in the staging site directory as determined from the Site
   Catalog and planner options. This can result in too many files in one
   directory for large workflows, and was the only option before Pegasus
   4.7.0 release.

2. **Hashed** : This mapper results in the creation of a deep directory
   structure rooted at the staging site directory created by the create
   dir jobs. The binning is at the job level, and not at the file level
   i.e each job will push out it's outputs to the same directory on the
   staging site, independent of the number of output files. To control
   behavior of this mapper, users can specify the following properties

   ::

      pegasus.dir.staging.mapper.hashed.levels     the number of directory levels used to accomodate the files. Defaults to 2.
      pegasus.dir.staging.mapper.hashed.multiplier the number of files associated with a job in the submit directory. defaults to 5.

..

.. note::

   The staging mappers are only triggered if pegasus.data.configuration
   is set to nonsharedfs

.. _ref-output-mapper:

Output Mappers
==============

Starting 4.3 release, Pegasus has support for output mappers, that allow
users fine grained control over how the output files on the output site
are laid out. By default, Pegasus stages output products to the storage
directory specified in the site catalog for the output site. Output
mappers allow users finer grained control over where the output files
are placed on the output site.

To configure the output mapper, you need to specify the following
property

::

   pegasus.dir.storage.mapper  <name of the mapper to use>

The following mappers are supported currently

1. **Flat** : By default, Pegasus will place the output files in the
   storage directory specified in the site catalog for the output site.

2. **Fixed** : This mapper allows users to specify an externally
   accesible url to the storage directory in their properties file. To
   use this mapper, the following property needs to be set.

   -  pegasus.dir.storage.mapper.fixed.url an externally accessible URL
      to the storage directory on the output site e.g.
      gsiftp://outputs.isi.edu/shared/outputs

   Note: For hierarchal workflows, the above property needs to be set
   separately for each pegasusWorkflow job, if you want the sub workflow
   outputs to goto a different directory.

3. **Hashed** : This mapper results in the creation of a deep directory
   structure on the output site, while populating the results. The base
   directory on the remote end is determined from the site catalog.
   Depending on the number of files being staged to the remote site a
   Hashed File Structure is created that ensures that only 256 files
   reside in one directory. To create this directory structure on the
   storage site, Pegasus relies on the directory creation feature of the
   underlying file servers such as theGrid FTP server, which appeared in
   globus 4.0.x

4. **Replica:** This mapper determines the path for an output file on
   the output site by querying an output replica catalog. The output
   site is one that is passed on the command line. The output replica
   catalog can be configured by specifying the following properties.

   -  pegasus.dir.storage.mapper.replica Regex|File

   -  pegasus.dir.storage.mapper.replica.file the RC file at the backend
      to use

   Please note that the output replica catalog ( even though the formats
   are the same) is logically different from the input replica catalog,
   where you specify the locations for the input files. You cannot
   specify the locations for the output files to be used by the mapper
   in the Abstract Workflow. The format for the File based replica catalog is
   described `here <#rc-FILE>`__, while for the Regex it is
   `here <#rc-regex>`__.

Effect of pegasus.dir.storage.deep
----------------------------------

For Flat and Hashed output mappers, the base directory to which the add
on component is added is determined by the property
pegasus.dir.storage.deep . The output directory on the output site is
determined from the site catalog.

If pegasus.dir.storage.deep is set to true, then to this base directory,
a relative directory is appended i.e. $storage_base = $base +
$relative_directory. The relative directory is computed on the basis of
the --relative-dir option. If that is not set, then defaults to the
relative submit directory for the workflow ( usually
$user/$vogroup/$label/runxxxx ).This is the base directory that is
passed to the storage mappers.

.. _data-cleanup:

Data Cleanup
============

When executing large workflows, users often may run out of diskspace on
the remote clusters / staging site. Pegasus provides a couple of ways of
enabling automated data cleanup on the staging site ( i.e the scratch
space used by the workflows). This is achieved by adding data cleanup
jobs to the executable workflow that the Pegasus Mapper generates. These
cleanup jobs are responsible for removing files and directories during
the workflow execution. To enable data cleanup you can pass the
--cleanup option to pegasus-plan . The value passed decides the cleanup
strategy implemented

1. **none** disables cleanup altogether. The planner does not add any
   cleanup jobs in the executable workflow whatsoever.

2. **leaf** the planner adds a leaf cleanup node per staging site that
   removes the directory created by the create dir job in the workflow

3. **inplace** the mapper adds cleanup nodes per level of the workflow
   in addition to leaf cleanup nodes. The nodes remove files no longer
   required during execution. For example, an added cleanup node will
   remove input files for a particular compute job after the job has
   finished successfully. Starting 4.8.0 release, the number of cleanup
   nodes created by this algorithm on a particular level, is dictated by
   the number of nodes it encounters on a level of the workflow.

4. **constraint** the mapper adds cleanup nodes to constraint the amount
   of storage space used by a workflow, in addition to leaf cleanup
   nodes. The nodes remove files no longer required during execution.
   The added cleanup node guarantees limits on disk usage. File sizes
   are read from the **size** flag in the Abstract Workflow, or from a CSV file
   (`pegasus.file.cleanup.constraint.csv <#cleanup_props>`__).

..

.. note::

   For large workflows with lots of files, the inplace strategy may take
   a long time as the algorithm works at a per file level to figure out
   when it is safe to remove a file.

Behaviour of the cleanup strategies implemented in the Pegasus Mapper
can be controlled by properties described `here <#cleanup_props>`__.

Data Cleanup in Hierarchical Workflows
--------------------------------------

By default, for hierarchical workflows the inplace cleanup is always
turned off. However, you can enable cleanup for your workflows if either of
the following two conditions hold true

* you have no data dependencies across the *pegasusWorkflow* jobs, OR

* if you have data dependencies between two *pegasusWorkflow* jobs, they are
  explicitly tracked by enumerating them as inputs and outputs when defining
  the pegasusWorkflow jobs

**AND**

* you can set the property

    -  pegasus.file.cleanup.scope deferred

This will result in cleanup option to be picked up from the arguments
for the pegasusWorkflow job in the top level Abstract Workflow .

Before the 5.0.1 release, you could only enable inplace cleanup for your
hierarchical workflows if there were no data dependencies between *pegasusWorkflow*
jobs.

Metadata
========

Pegasus allows users to associate metadata with the following:

- **Workflow**
- **Job**
- **Transformation**
- **TransformationSite**
- **File**

Metadata is specified as a key value pair, where both key and values
are of type String.

All the metadata (both user specified and auto-generated) gets populated
into the workflow database (usually in the workflow submit directory)
by *pegasus-monitord*. The metadata in this database can be be queried
using the :ref:`cli-pegasus-metadata` command line
tool and is also shown in the :ref:`Pegasus Dashboard <dashboard>`.

.. note::

   When the transformation that a job uses has metadata associated with it, that
   metadata also gets associated with the job. This is similar to how profiles
   are handled with transformations and jobs.

.. _metadata-auto:

Automatically Generated Metadata attributes
-------------------------------------------

Pegasus captures certain metadata attributes as output files are
generated and associates them at the file level in the database.
Currently, the following attributes for the output files are
automatically captured from the kickstart record and stored in the
workflow database.

-  **pfn** - the physical file location

-  **ctime** - creation time

-  **size** - size of the file in bytes

-  **user** - the linux user as who the process ran that generated the
   output file.

..

.. note::

   The automatic collection of the metadata attributes for output files
   is **only triggered if the output file is marked to be registered** in
   the replica catalog, and ``--output-site`` option to ``pegasus-plan`` is
   specified.

.. _metadata-trace:

Tracing Metadata For an Output File
-----------------------------------

The command line client :ref:`pegasus-metadata <cli-pegasus-metadata>`
allows a user to trace all the metadata associated with the file. The
client will display metadata for the output file, the task that
generated the file, the workflow which contains the task, and the root

Integrity Checking
==================

Pegasus adds checksum computation and integrity checking steps for non
shared filesystem deployments (nonsharedfs and condorio). The main
motivation to do this is to ensure that any data transferred for a
workflow does not get inadvertently corrupted during data transfers
performed during workflow execution, or at rest at a staging site. Users
now have options to specify **sha256** checksums for the input files in
the replica catalog. If checksums are not provided, then Pegasus will
compute the checksums for the files during data transfers, and enforce
these checksums whenever a PegasusLite job starts on a remote node. The
checksums for outputs created by user executable are generated and
published by *pegasus-kickstart*\ in it's provenance record. The
kickstart output is brought back to the submit host as part of the job
standard output using in-built HTCondor file transfer mechanisms. The
generated checksums are then populated in the Stampede workflow
database.

PegasusLite wrapped jobs invoke *pegasus-integrity-check* before
launching any computational task. *pegasus-integrity-check* computes
checksums on files and compares them against existing checksum values
passed to it in its input. We also have extended our transfer tool
pegasus-transfer to invoke pegasus-integrity check after completing the
transfer of files.

Integrity checks in the workflows are implemented at 3 levels

1. after the input data has been staged to staging server -
   pegasus-transfer verifies integrity of the staged files.

2. before a compute task starts on a remote compute node - This ensures
   that checksums of the data staged in match the checksums specified in
   the input replica catalog or the ones computed when that piece of
   data was generated as part of previous task in the workflow.

3. after the workflow output data has been transferred to storage
   servers - This ensures that output data staged to the final location
   was not corrupted in transit.

The `figure <#fig_pegasus_integrity_checking>`__ below illustrates the
points at which integrity checks are implemented. In our approach, the
reference checksums for the input files for a job are sent to the remote
node where a job executes using in-built HTCondor file transfer
mechanism.

   Pegasus Integrity Checking

Currently, there are few scenarios where integrity checks will not
happen in case of non shared filesystem deployments

-  checksums are not enforced for user executables specified in the
   transformation catalog. In future, we plan to support checksumming
   for staged executable.

-  If you have set pegasus.transfer.bypass.input.staging to true to
   enable the bypass of staging of input files via the staging server,
   and have not specified the checksums in the replica catalog.

.. _integrity-checking-stats:

Integrity Checking Statistics
-----------------------------

`pegasus-statistics <#cli-pegasus-statistics>`__ now includes a section
containing integrity statistics:

::

       # Integrity Metrics
       # Number of files for which checksums were compared/computed along with total time spent doing it.
       171 files checksums generated with total duration of 8.705 secs

       # Integrity Errors
       # Total:
       #       Total number of integrity errors encountered across all job executions(including retries) of a workflow.
       # Failures:
       #       Number of failed jobs where the last job instance had integrity errors.
       Failures: 0 job failures had integrity errors

.. _integrity-checking-dials:

Integrity Checking Dials
------------------------

Currently we support following dials for integrity checking.

-  **none** - no integrity checking

-  **full** - full integrity checking for non shared filesystem
   deployments at the 3 levels described in this section.

- **nosymlink** - symlinked files will not be integrity checked

By default integrity checking dial is set to full . To change this you
can set the following property

::

   pegasus.integrity.checking    none|full|nosymlink

.. _integrity-checking-rc:

Specifying Checksums in Replica Catalog
---------------------------------------

For raw input files for your workflow you can specify the checksums
along with file locations in the Replica Catalog. Pegasus will check
against these checksums when a PegasusLite job starts up on a remote
node. If checksums are not specified, then Pegasus will compute them
during the data transfer to the staging site, and use them.

To specify checksums in replica catalog, you need to specify two
additonal attributes with your LFN -> PFN mapping.

1. **checksum.type** The checksum type. Currently only type of sha256 is
   supported

2. **checksum.value** The checksum for the file

For example here is how you would specify the checksum for a file in a
file based replica catalog

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python generate_rc.py

        from Pegasus.api import *

        infile = File('input.txt')
        rc = ReplicaCatalog()\
              .add_replica('local', infile, "http://example.com/pegasus/input/" + infile.lfn,\
                            checksum = {'sha256':'66a42b4be204c824a7533d2c677ff7cc5c44526300ecd6b450602e06128063f9'})\
               .write()

        # the Replica Catalog will be written to the default path "./replicas.yml"

    .. code-tab:: yaml YAML RC

        pegasus: '5.0'
        replicas:
          - lfn: input.txt
            pfns:
              - {site: local, pfn: 'http://example.com/pegasus/input/input.txt'}
            checksum: {sha256: 66a42b4be204c824a7533d2c677ff7cc5c44526300ecd6b450602e06128063f9}

    .. code-tab:: shell File RC

        # file-based replica catalog: 2018-10-25T02:10:02.293-07:00
        input.txt http://example.com/pegasus/input/input.txt checksum.type="sha256" checksum.value="66a42b4be204c824a7533d2c677ff7cc5c44526300ecd6b450602e06128063f9" site="condorpool"
