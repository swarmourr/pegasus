Usage Statistics Collection
===========================

.. _usage-stats-purpose:

Purpose
-------

Pegasus WMS is primarily a NSF funded project. As part of
the requirements of this funding, Pegasus WMS is
required to gather usage statistics of Pegasus WMS and report it back to
NSF in annual reports. The metrics will also enable us to improve our
software as they will include errors encountered during the use of our
software.

.. _usage-stats-overview:

Overview
--------

We plan to instrument and augment the following clients in our
distribution to report the metrics.

-  pegasus-plan

-  pegasus-transfer

-  pegasus-monitord

For the Pegasus WMS 4.2 release, only the pegasus-plan client has been
instrumented to send metrics.

All the metrics are sent in JSON format to a server at USC/ISI over
HTTP. The data reported is as generic as possible and is listed in
detail in the section titled `"Metrics
Collected" <#usage_metrics_collected>`__.

.. _usage-stats-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

By default, the clients will report usage metrics to a server at ISI.
However, users have an option to configure the report by setting the
following environment variables

-  PEGASUS_METRICS

   A boolean value ( true \| false ) indicating whether metrics
   reporting is turned ON/OFF

-  PEGASUS_USER_METRICS_SERVER

   A comma separated list of URLs of the servers to which to report the
   metrics in addition to the default server.

.. _usage-metrics-collected:

Metrics Collected
-----------------

All metrics are sent in JSON format and the metrics sent by the various
clients include the following data

.. table:: Common Data Sent By Pegasus WMS Clients

   ========== ======================================================================================
   JSON KEY   DESCRIPTION
   ========== ======================================================================================
   client     the name of the client ( e.g "pegasus-plan")
   version    the version of the client
   type       type of data - "metrics" \| "error"
   start_time start time of the client ( in epoch seconds with millisecond precision )

   total_jobs       the total number of jobs in the workflow
   ================ =============================================================================================================

In addition if pegasus-plan encounters an error during the planning
process the metrics message has an additional field in addition to the
fields listed above.

.. table:: Error Message sent by pegasus-plan

   ======== =====================================================================
   JSON KEY DESCRIPTION
   ======== =====================================================================
   error    the error payload is the stack trace of errors caught during planning
   ======== =====================================================================

.. note::

   pegasus-plan leaves a copy of the metrics sent in the workflow submit
   directory in the file ending with ".metrics" extension. As a user you
   will always have access to the metrics sent.
