Basic Properties
================

Properties are primarily used to configure the behavior of the Pegasus
Workflow Planner at a global level. The properties file is actually a
java properties file and follows the same conventions as that to specify
the properties.

Please note that the values rely on proper capitalization, unless
explicitly noted otherwise.

Some properties rely with their default on the value of other
properties. As a notation, the curly braces refer to the value of the
named property. For instance, ${pegasus.home} means that the value
depends on the value of the pegasus.home property plus any noted
additions. You can use this notation to refer to other properties,
though the extent of the subsitutions are limited. Usually, you want to
refer to a set of the standard system properties. Nesting is not
allowed. Substitutions will only be done once.

There is a priority to the order of reading and evaluating properties.
Usually one does not need to worry about the priorities. However, it is
good to know the details of when which property applies, and how one
property is able to overwrite another. The following is a mutually
exclusive list ( highest priority first ) of property file locations.

1. --conf option to the tools. Almost all of the clients that use
   properties have a --conf option to specify the property file to pick
   up.
2. submit-dir/pegasus.xxxxxxx.properties file. All tools that work on
   the submit directory ( i.e after pegasus has planned a workflow) pick
   up the pegasus.xxxxx.properties file from the submit directory. The
   location for the pegasus.xxxxxxx.propertiesis picked up from the
   braindump file.
3. The properties defined in the user property file
   ${user.home}/.pegasusrc
   have lowest priority.

Starting Pegasus 5.0 release, pegasus properties can also be specified as
environment variables. The properties specified by an environment variable
have higher precedence than those specified in a properties file.

To specify a pegasus property as an environment variable you need to
do the following:

1. Convert your property name to upper case
2. Replace . with __ .
3. Add a leading _ to the property name.

For example, to specify pegasus.catalog.replica in your environment you
will specify

..

 _PEGASUS__CATALOG__REPLICA__FILE = /path/to/replicas.yml


Commandline properties have the highest priority. These override any
property loaded from a property file. Each commandline property is
introduced by a -D argument. Note that these arguments are parsed by the
shell wrapper, and thus the -D arguments must be the first arguments to
any command. Commandline properties are useful for debugging purposes.

From Pegasus 3.1 release onwards, support has been dropped for the
following properties that were used to signify the location of the
properties file

-  pegasus.properties
-  pegasus.user.properties

The basic properties that you may need to be set if using non default
   types and locations are for various catalogs are listed below:

   .. table:: Basic Properties that you may need to set

      ====================================== ===============================
      pegasus.catalog.replica                type of replica catalog backend
      pegasus.catalog.replica.file           path to replica catalog file
      pegasus.catalog.transformation         type of transformation catalog
      pegasus.catalog.transformation.file    path to transformation file
      pegasus.catalog.site.file              path to site catalog file
      pegasus.data.configuration             the data configuration mode for
                                             data staging.
      ====================================== ===============================

If you are in doubt which properties are actually visible, pegasus
during the planning of the workflow dumps all properties after reading
and prioritizing in the submit directory in a file with the suffix
properties.
