MPI version of KEG

   ::

      pegasus-mpi-keg [-a appname] [-t interval |-T interval] [-l logname]
                  [-P prefix] [-o fn [..]] [-i fn [..]] [-G sz] [-m memory]
                  [-r root_memory_allocation] [-C] [-e env [..]] [-p parm [..]]



Description
===========

The parallel version of kanonical executable is a stand-in for parallel
binaries in a DAG - but not for their arguments. It allows to trace the
shape of the execution of a DAG, and thus is an aid to debugging DAG
related issues.

It works in the same way as the sequential version of **pegasus-keg**
but it is intended to be executed as an MPI task. **pegasus-mpi-keg**
accepts the same parameters as **pegasus-keg**, so please refer to the
**pegasus-keg** manual page for more details.



Arguments
=========

The same as **pegasus-keg**. But there are some MPI-specific arguments.

**-r root_memory_allocation_only**
   Works use only with the **-m** option. When set, the memory
   allocation will take place in the root MPI process only. By default,
   each MPI processe allocates the amount of memory set by the **-m**
   option.



Return Value
============

The same as **pegasus-keg**.



Example
=======

The example shows the bracketing of an input file, and the copy produced
on the output file. For illustration purposes, the output file is
connected to *stdout* :
